## Welcome danish teachers! 

In this repository, you will find a Streamlit application built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and ChatGPT. The primary goal of this project is to provide Danish teachers with an easy-to-use interface where they can upload documents. The uploaded documents are then used by the model to generate new assignments and educational materials. This application simplifies the process of updating the model with new information and offers a user-friendly platform for teachers to work with.

Key features of this Streamlit application include:

Document Upload: Teachers can easily upload their documents through the interface.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: The application uses RAG to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated content.
ChatGPT Integration: Leveraging the power of ChatGPT, the application generates assignments in various formats, such as grammar exercises, text generation, and question generation.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, the interface allows teachers to quickly and efficiently create educational content tailored to their needs.

This project aims to support Danish educators by providing them with a powerful tool to create high-quality, customized assignments from their own documents.


Additionally, you will also find two Google Colab notebooks in this repository, which demonstrate prompt engineering techniques based on Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for Llama 3 and Mistral. These notebooks showcase how to utilize these models to generate Danish assignments.
